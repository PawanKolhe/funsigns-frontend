# FUNSIGNS

Submission by team _Alphaknights_ for Code Innovation Series - Amity University Mumbai hackathon: https://incubateind.com/hack/amitymumbai

Funsigns is a reward-based web platform where students can enjoy doing assignments while earning rewards.

We hate doing class assignments because it had no incentive for the student other than getting good grades. Assignments are however an important part of learning. One needs to get a sense of progress in the short-term while doing assignments for them to enjoy it. Funsigns is built with the elements of Gamification, so that students complete assignments as if they were levels in a video game.

## Features:
- Login & Registration - Student and Faculty
- Faculty can add courses with assignments
- Students receive badges on completing assignments
- Plagiarism check when submitting assignment
- Progress bar for monthly assignment submission goals
- Targets academic institutes (colleges and schools)
